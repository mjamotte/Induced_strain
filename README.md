# Induced_strain
Interacting-induced strain with cold atoms in optical lattices

The Master thesis is focused on simulating strain thanks to interactions in a mixture of two species of ultracold atoms. The first species is fermionic and the second one is bosonic. The bosons form a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Until now we negelcted the quantum fluctuations of the BEC.
